// RateLimiter is a utility that can be used to limit the maximum rate that any
// event could happen, defined by its consumers. All it needs to receive is the
// timestamp of the next event, which must be sent in ascending order. It will
// handle any internal state necessary for rate limiting the events, given the
// configuration of maximum number of events allowed in an interval. The zero
// value for RateLimiter is one that never allows any event.
//
// Notice that, since it is used for a financial system, it uses an expensive
// algorithm optimized to give the exact answer given the past recent events. It
// is not appropriate for handling a very large number of events, say for
// rate-limiting requests on a web server. In that other case, we could use some
// more efficient algorithm here like a periodically resetting counter or a
// leaky bucket, which would save a lot of CPU and memory but allow for several
// edge cases with the wrong response regarding exceeding the rate limit or not.
